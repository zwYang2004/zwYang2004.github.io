I'm a third year undergraduate student from School of Mathematical Sciences, [Yangzhou University](http://english.yzu.edu.cn). My research interest includes Mathematical Modeling, Computational Biology, Deep Learning and AI in Healthcare. 



I am currently a visiting student at the [Laboratory for Proteome Complexity Science](https://guomics.com), [Westlake University](https://en.westlake.edu.cn), fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Tiannan Guo](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/tiannan-guo.html). During my undergraduate studies, I was advised by Prof. [Lai Zhang](https://teacher.yzu.edu.cn/ZL123456789101112131415161718192021/zh_CN/index.htm) on projects related to mathematical modeling and biomathematics at Yangzhou University.


<span style="color: red;">Curerntly, I'm actively seeking a **MPhil or Ph.D. opportunities** for 2026 Fall. If you are interested in me, please contact me! My CV is available here: [CV (last update: 2025.6)](../assets/Yang_Zhiwen_CV_Mathematic_F2026.pdf).</span>
