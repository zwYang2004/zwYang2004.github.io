This patent stems from research conducted with Prof. Lai Zhang  on computational modeling for environmental science.

Key technical details include:
* Construction of complex unstructured grids in Matlab, with over 17,000 nodes and 99,000 connections, to represent the marine environment. 
* Development of a novel advection-diffusion coupling algorithm to simulate PDE equations that model the dynamic migration of microplastics. 
* Application of improved ecological models (**Lotka-Volterra**) to assess the dynamic changes in fish populations resulting from microplastic exposure.
