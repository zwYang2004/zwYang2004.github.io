This research, conducted under the supervision of Prof. Tiannan Guo at Westlake University, focuses on a significant challenge in computational biology.

Key contributions include:
* Developed an innovative imputation model named AutoPIM for missing values in proteomics data by **Pytorch**, combining an Autoencoder (AE) with a prediction network to address MNAR data.
* Trained and evaluated the model on both simulated and real proteomics data, comparing it against multiple baseline models to demonstrate its superior performance.
* The resulting manuscript is currently in preparation.
