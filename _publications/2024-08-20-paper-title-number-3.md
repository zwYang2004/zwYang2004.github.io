Supervised by Prof. Jianfei Huang, this project applied machine learning techniques to biostatistics data.

Key contributions include:
* Designed a hybrid model combining Random Forest and MLP to predict infant behavior using maternal psychological data, achieving an AUC value of **0.97** and improving the validation set performance by over **15%**. 
* Applied the **Fuzzy C-Means clustering** algorithm to grade the infant sleep quality and developed a regression model to deeply explore the relationship between maternal anxiety and infants' contradictory behaviors.
