Under the supervision of Prof. Lai Zhang, this project combines computational modeling and ecological theory to study pollution dynamics.

Key contributions include:
* Used Matlab to construct complex unstructured grids, which consisted of **17,656** nodes and **99,948** connection information.
* Developed an advection-diffusion coupling algorithm to simulate **PDE** equations, demonstrating the dynamic migration patterns of microplastics in the marine environment.
* Improved the Logistic model and the **Lotka-Volterra** model, accurately depicting the dynamic changes in the population sizes of predator and prey fish schools.
