This project addresses the accuracy limitations of traditional KAN architectures in medical imaging.

Key contributions include:
* Employed Gaussian smoothing preprocessing, boundary loss functions and regularization strategies to reduce segmentation errors. 
* Incorporated the **ECA Attention Module** to enhance feature focusing capabilities. 
* Achieved a Dice score of **92.89%** in medical image segmentation tasks, highlighting the high efficiency of the method.
